This is a sweet simple multivagrant program that uses centOS boxes.
By default it creates 3 boxes with specified hostname, role, ip (set as private network), autostart (so you can set if the box can be brought up automatically by vagrant up) and size of ram.

I also include a helloworld module so that you can test if master/client can talk to each other in an appropriate way. But you don't have to use it.
